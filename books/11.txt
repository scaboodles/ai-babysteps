pattering footstep distance looked eagerly half hoping mouse changed mind coming back finish story chapter iv rabbit sends little bill white rabbit trotting slowly back looking anxiously went lost something heard muttering “the duchess duchess oh dear paw oh fur whisker she’ll get executed sure ferret ferret dropped wonder” alice guessed moment looking fan pair white kid glove goodnaturedly began hunting nowhere seen—everything seemed changed since swim pool great hall glass table little door vanished completely soon rabbit noticed alice went hunting called angry tone “why mary ann run

interesting sure happen” said “whenever eat drink anything i’ll see bottle hope it’ll make grow large really i’m quite tired tiny little thing” indeed much sooner expected drunk half bottle found head pressing ceiling stoop save neck broken hastily put bottle saying “that’s quite enough—i hope shan’t grow more—as can’t get door—i wish hadn’t drunk quite much” ala late wish went growing growing soon kneel floor another minute even room tried effect lying one elbow door arm curled round head still went growing last resource put one arm window one foot chimney said “now whatever happens become me” luckily alice little magic bottle full effect grew larger still uncomfortable seemed sort chance ever getting room wonder felt unhappy “it much pleasanter home” thought poor alice “when one wasn’t always growing larger smaller ordered mouse rabbit almost wish hadn’t gone rabbithole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious know sort life wonder happened used read fairytale fancied kind thing never happened middle one ought book written ought grow i’ll write one—but i’m grown now” added sorrowful tone “at least there’s room grow here” “but then” thought alice “shall never get older that’ll comfort one way—never old woman—but then—always lesson learn oh shouldn’t like that” “oh foolish alice” answered “how learn lesson there’s hardly room room lessonbooks” went taking first one side making quite conversation altogether minute heard voice outside stopped listen “mary ann mary ann” said voice “fetch glove moment” came little pattering foot stair alice knew rabbit coming look trembled till shook house quite forgetting thousand time large rabbit reason afraid presently rabbit came door tried open door opened inwards alice’s elbow pressed hard attempt proved failure alice heard say “then i’ll go round get window” “that won’t” thought alice waiting till fancied heard rabbit window suddenly spread hand made snatch air get hold anything heard little shriek fall crash broken glass concluded possible fallen cucumberframe something sort next came angry voice—the rabbit’s—“pat pat you” voice never heard “sure i’m digging apple yer honour” “digging apple indeed” said rabbit angrily “here come help this” sound broken glass “now tell pat what’s window” “sure it’s arm yer honour” pronounced “arrum” “an arm goose ever saw one size fill whole window” “sure yer honour it’s arm that” “well it’s got business rate go take away” long silence alice could hear whisper “sure don’t like yer honour all” “do tell coward” last spread hand made another snatch air time two little shriek sound broken glass “what number cucumberframes must be” thought alice “i wonder they’ll next pulling window wish could i’m sure don’t want stay longer” waited time without hearing anything last came rumbling little cartwheel sound good many voice talking together made word “where’s ladder—why hadn’t bring one bill’s got other—bill fetch lad—here put ’em corner—no tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—oh they’ll well enough don’t particular—here bill catch hold rope—will roof bear—mind loose slate—oh it’s coming head below” loud crash—“now

wouldn’t bill’s place good deal fireplace narrow sure think kick little” drew foot far chimney could waited till heard little animal couldn’t guess sort scratching scrambling chimney close saying “this bill” gave one sharp kick waited see would happen next first thing heard general chorus “there go bill” rabbit’s voice along—“catch hedge” silence another confusion voices—“hold head—brandy now—don’t choke him—how old fellow happened tell u it” last came little feeble squeaking voice “that’s bill” thought alice “well hardly know—no thank ye i’m better now—but i’m deal flustered tell you—all know something come like jackinthebox go like skyrocket” “so old fellow” said others “we must burn house down” said rabbit’s voice alice called loud could “if i’ll set dinah you” dead silence instantly alice thought “i wonder next sense they’d take roof off” minute two began moving alice heard rabbit say “a barrowful begin with” “a barrowful what” thought alice long doubt next moment shower little pebble came rattling window hit face “i’ll put stop this” said shouted “you’d better again” produced another dead silence alice noticed surprise pebble turning little cake lay floor bright idea came head “if eat one cakes” thought “it’s sure make change size can’t possibly make larger must make smaller suppose” swallowed one cake delighted find began shrinking directly soon small enough get door ran house found quite crowd little animal bird waiting outside poor little lizard bill middle held two guineapigs giving something bottle made rush alice moment appeared ran hard could soon found safe thick wood “the first thing i’ve got do” said alice wandered wood “is grow right size second thing find way lovely garden think best plan” sounded excellent plan doubt neatly simply arranged difficulty smallest idea set peering anxiously among tree little sharp bark head made look great hurry enormous puppy looking large round eye feebly stretching one paw trying touch “poor little thing” said alice coaxing tone tried hard whistle terribly frightened time thought might hungry case would likely eat spite coaxing hardly knowing picked little bit stick held puppy whereupon puppy jumped air foot yelp delight rushed stick made believe worry alice dodged behind great thistle keep run moment appeared side puppy made another rush stick tumbled head heel hurry get hold alice thinking like game play carthorse expecting every moment trampled foot ran round thistle puppy began series short charge stick running little way forward time long way back barking hoarsely till last sat good way panting tongue hanging mouth great eye half shut seemed alice good opportunity making escape set ran till quite tired breath till puppy’s bark sounded quite faint distance “and yet dear little puppy was” said alice leant buttercup rest fanned one leaf “i liked teaching trick much if—if i’d right size oh dear i’d nearly forgotten i’ve got grow let see—how managed suppose ought eat drink something great question what” great question certainly alice looked round flower blade grass see anything looked like right thing eat drink circumstance large mushroom growing near height looked side behind occurred might well look see top stretched tiptoe peeped edge mushroom eye immediately met large blue caterpillar sitting top arm folded quietly smoking long hookah taking smallest notice anything else chapter v advice caterpillar caterpillar alice looked time silence last caterpillar took hookah mouth addressed languid sleepy voice “who you” said caterpillar encouraging opening conversation alice replied rather shyly “i—i hardly know sir present—at least know got morning think must changed several time since then” “what mean that” said caterpillar sternly “explain yourself” “i can’t explain i’m afraid sir” said alice “because i’m see” “i don’t see” said caterpillar “i’m afraid can’t put clearly” alice replied politely “for can’t understand begin many different size day confusing” “it isn’t” said caterpillar “well perhaps haven’t found yet” said alice “but turn chrysalis—you day know—and butterfly think you’ll feel little queer won’t you” “not bit” said caterpillar “well perhaps feeling may different” said alice “all know would feel queer me” “you” said caterpillar contemptuously “who you” brought back beginning conversation alice felt little irritated caterpillar’s making short remark drew said gravely “i think ought tell first” “why” said caterpillar another puzzling question alice could think good reason caterpillar seemed unpleasant state mind turned away “come back” caterpillar called “i’ve something important say” sounded promising certainly alice turned came back “keep temper” said caterpillar “is all” said alice swallowing anger well could “no” said caterpillar alice thought might well wait nothing else perhaps might tell something worth hearing minute puffed away without speaking last unfolded arm took hookah mouth said “so think you’re changed you” “i’m afraid sir” said alice “i can’t remember thing used—and don’t keep size ten minute together” “can’t remember things” said caterpillar “well i’ve tried say “how doth little busy bee” came different” alice replied melancholy voice “repeat “you old father william’” said caterpillar alice folded hand began— “you old father william” young man said     “and hair become white yet incessantly stand head—     think age right” “in youth” father william replied son     “i feared might injure brain i’m perfectly sure none     again” “you old” said youth “as mentioned     grown uncommonly fat yet turned backsomersault door—     pray reason that” “in youth” said sage shook grey lock     “i kept limb supple use ointment—one shilling box—     allow sell couple” “you old” said youth “and jaw weak     anything tougher suet yet finished goose bone beak—     pray manage it” “in youth” said father “i took law     argued case wife muscular strength gave jaw     lasted rest life” “you old” said youth “one would hardly suppose     eye steady ever yet balanced eel end nose—     made awfully clever” “i answered three question enough”     said father “don’t give air think listen day stuff     i’ll kick stairs” “that said right” said caterpillar “not quite right i’m afraid” said alice timidly “some word got altered” “it wrong beginning end” said caterpillar decidedly silence minute caterpillar first speak “what size want be” asked “oh i’m particular size” alice hastily replied “only one doesn’t like changing often know” “i don’t know” said caterpillar alice said nothing never much contradicted life felt losing temper “are content now” said caterpillar “well like little larger sir wouldn’t mind” said alice “three inch wretched height be” “it good height indeed” said caterpillar angrily rearing upright spoke exactly three inch high “but i’m used it” pleaded poor alice piteous tone thought “i wish creature wouldn’t easily offended” “you’ll get used time” said caterpillar put hookah mouth began smoking time alice waited patiently chose speak minute two caterpillar took hookah mouth yawned twice shook got mushroom crawled away grass merely remarking went “one side make grow taller side make grow shorter” “one side side what” thought alice “of mushroom” said caterpillar asked aloud another moment sight alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom minute trying make two side perfectly round found difficult question however last stretched arm round far would go broke bit edge hand “and which” said nibbled little righthand bit try effect next moment felt violent blow underneath chin struck foot good deal frightened sudden change felt time lost shrinking rapidly set work eat bit chin pressed closely foot hardly room open mouth last managed swallow morsel lefthand bit                                                                                                              “come head’s free last” said alice tone delight changed alarm another moment found shoulder nowhere found could see looked immense length neck seemed rise like stalk sea green leaf lay far “what green stuff be” said alice “and shoulder got oh poor hand can’t see you” moving spoke result seemed follow except little shaking among distant green leaf seemed chance getting hand head tried get head delighted find neck would bend easily direction like serpent succeeded curving graceful zigzag going dive among leaf found nothing top tree wandering sharp hiss made draw back hurry large pigeon flown face beating violently wing “serpent” screamed pigeon “i’m serpent” said alice indignantly “let alone” “serpent say again” repeated pigeon subdued tone added kind sob “i’ve tried every way nothing seems suit them” “i haven’t least idea you’re talking about” said alice “i’ve tried root tree i’ve tried bank i’ve tried hedges” pigeon went without attending “but serpent there’s pleasing them” alice puzzled thought use saying anything till pigeon finished “as wasn’t trouble enough hatching eggs” said pigeon “but must lookout serpent night day haven’t wink sleep three weeks” “i’m sorry you’ve annoyed” said alice beginning see meaning “and i’d taken highest tree wood” continued pigeon raising voice shriek “and thinking free last must need come wriggling sky ugh serpent” “but i’m serpent tell you” said alice “i’m a—i’m a—” “well you” said pigeon “i see you’re trying invent something” “i—i’m little girl” said alice rather doubtfully remembered number change gone day “a likely story indeed” said pigeon tone deepest contempt “i’ve seen good many little girl time never one neck you’re serpent there’s use denying suppose you’ll telling next never tasted egg” “i tasted egg certainly” said alice truthful child “but little girl eat egg quite much serpent know” “i don’t believe it” said pigeon “but they’re kind serpent that’s say” new idea alice quite silent minute two gave pigeon opportunity adding “you’re looking egg know well enough matter whether you’re little girl serpent” “it matter good deal me” said alice hastily “but i’m looking egg happens shouldn’t want don’t like raw” “well then” said pigeon sulky tone settled nest alice crouched among tree well could neck kept getting entangled among branch every stop untwist remembered still held piece mushroom hand set work carefully nibbling first one growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter succeeded bringing usual height long since anything near right size felt quite strange first got used minute began talking usual “come there’s half plan done puzzling change i’m never sure i’m going one minute another however i’ve got back right size next thing get beautiful garden—how done wonder” said came suddenly upon open place little house four foot high “whoever life there” thought alice “it’ll never come upon size frighten wits” began nibbling righthand bit venture go near house till brought nine inch high chapter vi pig pepper minute two stood looking house wondering next suddenly footman livery came running wood—she considered footman livery otherwise judging face would called fish—and rapped loudly door knuckle opened another footman livery round face large eye like frog footman alice noticed powdered hair curled head felt curious know crept little way wood listen fishfootman began producing arm great letter nearly large handed saying solemn tone “for duchess invitation queen play croquet” frogfootman repeated solemn tone changing order word little “from queen invitation duchess play croquet” bowed low curl got entangled together alice laughed much run

quickly poor little juror bill lizard could make become hunting obliged write one finger rest day little use left mark slate “herald read accusation” said king white rabbit blew three blast trumpet unrolled parchment scroll read follows— “the queen heart made tart     summer day knave heart stole tart     took quite away” “consider verdict” king said jury “not yet yet” rabbit hastily interrupted “there’s great deal come that” “call first witness” said king white rabbit blew three blast trumpet called “first witness” first witness hatter came teacup one hand piece breadandbutter “i beg pardon majesty” began “for bringing hadn’t quite finished tea sent for” “you ought finished” said king “when begin” hatter looked march hare followed court arminarm dormouse “fourteenth march think was” said “fifteenth” said march hare “sixteenth” added dormouse “write down” king said jury jury eagerly wrote three date slate added reduced answer shilling penny “take hat” king said hatter “it isn’t mine” said hatter “stolen” king exclaimed turning jury instantly made memorandum fact “i keep sell” hatter added explanation “i’ve none i’m hatter” queen put spectacle began staring hatter turned pale fidgeted “give evidence” said king “and don’t nervous i’ll executed spot” seem encourage witness kept shifting one foot looking uneasily queen confusion bit large piece teacup instead breadandbutter moment alice felt curious sensation puzzled good deal made beginning grow larger thought first would get leave court second thought decided remain long room “i wish wouldn’t squeeze so” said dormouse sitting next “i hardly breathe” “i can’t help it” said alice meekly “i’m growing” “you’ve right grow here” said dormouse “don’t talk nonsense” said alice boldly “you know you’re growing too” “yes grow reasonable pace” said dormouse “not ridiculous fashion” got sulkily crossed side court time queen never left staring hatter dormouse crossed court said one officer court “bring list singer last concert” wretched hatter trembled shook shoe “give evidence” king repeated angrily “or i’ll executed whether you’re nervous not” “i’m poor man majesty” hatter began trembling voice “—and hadn’t begun tea—not week so—and breadandbutter getting thin—and twinkling tea—” “the twinkling what” said king “it began tea” hatter replied “of course twinkling begin t” said king sharply “do take dunce go on” “i’m poor man” hatter went “and thing twinkled that—only march hare said—” “i didn’t” march hare interrupted great hurry “you did” said hatter “i deny it” said march hare “he denies it” said king “leave part” “well rate dormouse said—” hatter went looking anxiously round see would deny dormouse denied nothing fast asleep “after that” continued hatter “i cut breadandbutter—” “but dormouse say” one jury asked “that can’t remember” said hatter “you must remember” remarked king “or i’ll executed” miserable hatter dropped teacup breadandbutter went one knee “i’m poor man majesty” began “you’re poor speaker” said king one guineapigs cheered immediately suppressed officer court rather hard word explain done large canvas bag tied mouth string slipped guineapig head first sat upon “i’m glad i’ve seen done” thought alice “i’ve often read newspaper end trial “there attempt applause immediately suppressed officer court” never understood meant till now” “if that’s know may stand down” continued king “i can’t go lower” said hatter “i’m floor is” “then may sit down” king replied guineapig cheered suppressed “come finished guineapigs” thought alice “now shall get better” “i’d rather finish tea” said hatter anxious look queen reading list singer “you may go” said king hatter hurriedly left court without even waiting put shoe “—and take head outside” queen added one officer hatter sight officer could get door “call next witness” said king next witness duchess’s cook carried pepperbox hand alice guessed even got court way people near door began sneezing “give evidence” said king “shan’t” said cook king looked anxiously white rabbit said low voice “your majesty must crossexamine witness” “well must must” king said melancholy air folding arm frowning cook till eye nearly sight said deep voice “what tart made of” “pepper mostly” said cook “treacle” said sleepy voice behind “collar dormouse” queen shrieked “behead dormouse turn dormouse court suppress pinch whiskers” minute whole court confusion getting dormouse turned time settled cook disappeared “never mind” said king air great relief “call next witness” added undertone queen “really dear must crossexamine next witness quite make forehead ache” alice watched white rabbit fumbled list feeling curious see next witness would like “—for haven’t got much evidence yet” said imagine surprise white rabbit read top shrill little voice name “alice” chapter xii alice’s evidence “here” cried alice quite forgetting flurry moment large grown last minute jumped hurry tipped jurybox edge skirt upsetting juryman head crowd lay sprawling reminding much globe goldfish accidentally upset week “oh beg pardon” exclaimed tone great dismay began picking quickly could accident goldfish kept running head vague sort idea must collected put back jurybox would die “the trial cannot proceed” said king grave voice “until juryman back proper places—all” repeated great emphasis looking hard alice said alice looked jurybox saw haste put lizard head downwards poor little thing waving tail melancholy way quite unable move soon got put right “not signifies much” said “i think would quite much use trial one way other” soon jury little recovered shock upset slate pencil found handed back set work diligently write history accident except lizard seemed much overcome anything sit mouth open gazing roof court “what know business” king said alice “nothing” said alice “nothing whatever” persisted king “nothing whatever” said alice “that’s important” king said turning jury beginning write slate white rabbit interrupted “unimportant majesty mean course” said respectful tone frowning making face spoke “unimportant course meant” king hastily said went undertone “important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” trying word sounded best jury wrote “important” “unimportant” alice could see near enough look slate “but doesn’t matter bit” thought moment king time busily writing notebook cackled “silence” read book “rule fortytwo person mile high leave court” everybody looked alice “i’m mile high” said alice “you are” said king “nearly two mile high” added queen “well shan’t go rate” said alice “besides that’s regular rule invented now” “it’s oldest rule book” said king “then ought number one” said alice king turned pale shut notebook hastily “consider verdict” said jury low trembling voice “there’s evidence come yet please majesty” said white rabbit jumping great hurry “this paper picked up” “what’s it” said queen “i haven’t opened yet” said white rabbit “but seems letter written prisoner to—to somebody” “it must that” said king “unless written nobody isn’t usual know” “who directed to” said one juryman “it isn’t directed all” said white rabbit “in fact there’s nothing written outside” unfolded paper spoke added “it isn’t letter it’s set verses” “are prisoner’s handwriting” asked another juryman “no they’re not” said white rabbit “and that’s queerest thing it” jury looked puzzled “he must imitated somebody else’s hand” said king jury brightened “please majesty” said knave “i didn’t write can’t prove there’s name signed end” “if didn’t sign it” said king “that make matter worse must meant mischief else you’d signed name like honest man” general clapping hand first really clever thing king said day “that prof guilt” said queen “it prof nothing sort” said alice “why don’t even know they’re about” “read them” said king white rabbit put spectacle “where shall begin please majesty” asked “begin beginning” king said gravely “and go till come end stop” verse white rabbit read— “they told     mentioned gave good character     said could swim sent word gone     know true push matter     would become gave one gave two     gave u three returned     though mine chance     involved affair trust set free     exactly notion     fit obstacle came     don’t let know liked best     must ever secret kept rest     me” “that’s important piece evidence we’ve heard yet” said king rubbing hand “so let jury—” “if one explain it” said alice grown large last minute wasn’t bit afraid interrupting “i’ll give sixpence don’t believe there’s atom meaning it” jury wrote slate “she doesn’t believe there’s atom meaning it” none attempted explain paper “if there’s meaning it” said king “that save world trouble know needn’t try find yet don’t know” went spreading verse knee looking one eye “i seem see meaning “—said could swim—” can’t swim you” added turning knave knave shook head sadly “do look like it” said certainly made entirely cardboard “all right far” said king went muttering verse “‘we know true—’ that’s jury course—‘i gave one gave two—’ must tart know—” “but go ‘they returned you’” said alice “why are” said king triumphantly pointing tart table “nothing clearer again—‘before fit—’ never fit dear think” said queen “never” said queen furiously throwing inkstand lizard spoke unfortunate little bill left writing slate one finger found made mark hastily began using ink trickling face long lasted “then word don’t fit you” said king looking round court smile dead silence “it’s pun” king added offended tone everybody laughed “let jury consider verdict” king said twentieth time day “no no” said queen “sentence first—verdict afterwards” “stuff nonsense” said alice loudly “the idea sentence first” “hold tongue” said queen turning purple “i won’t” said alice “off head” queen shouted top voice nobody moved “who care you” said alice grown full size time “you’re nothing pack cards” whole pack rose air came flying upon gave little scream half fright half
